You can currently choose from the following:\n- TiTN: Complete Trapped in the Nightmare, the base Night 20 with no items that alter the run or ending in any way.\n- BiD: Complete Burning it Down. This requires you to have the Gasoline and Lighter items and grab them from the Maintence room before Night 5. This will trigger a new route that works best for those who run the office.\n- PtWP: Complete Paint the World Purple. This requires you to obtain Jordi's Paint Brush and collect some Note Pieces from him (and the other Players, of course). This run leans more onto the Office, but still has some danger in the cameras. Balance well to succeed.\n- FS: Complete False Savior. This requires you to get Puppet to leave the Music Box 3 times before Night 5. This logically expects the Music Box Main Item since it makes it much easier to get her as a Threat choice. After starting this route, things will get hectic, especially for camera players. Good luck.\n- Collect Memory Fragments: Collect 20 Memory Fragments scattered across the Multiworld. Recommended for those playing in Syncs that don't mind an anticlimactic finish.\nNOTE: This number is subject to change; let me know if you have any suggestions for it.",
